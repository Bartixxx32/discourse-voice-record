# discourse-voice-record
Voice recording plugin for Discourse

A plugin that enables voice recording functionality for your Discourse forum directly in the browser - for both desktop and mobile users.

You can find the functionality in [english.best community forum](https://forum.english.best) to see how it works.

The library uses a slightly modified version of [Microm](https://github.com/zzarcon/microm) library, which features RecordRTC and lamejs.

Installation
---

After the [standard installation](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157), enable `composer_audio_upload_enabled` in the settings.

When composing a new message, simply click on the microphone icon to start recording. After you're done, your recording will be converted to mp3 for enhanced cross-browser compatibility.
